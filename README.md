FRServer
========
Not tested 100% yet, but seems a good start form making REST-API requests.

This Objective C class supports GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and many more HTTP-methods!

Android class support GET, POST HTTP-methods (just transfer the method you want in transfer[1])

It also contains a Python test server to test your Objective C app/ android app!
